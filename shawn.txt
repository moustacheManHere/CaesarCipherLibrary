In a world of vibrant hues, a soul named Shawn,
A spirit unbounded, a light brightly drawn.
With courage and grace, he walks his own way,
Embracing the truth that colors his day.

In the tapestry of life, his threads intertwine,
A rainbow of love, a spectrum divine.
For Shawn is gay, and proudly he stands,
In a world that's evolving, in welcoming lands.

With every step, he dances with pride,
A symphony of love, nothing to hide.
His heart beats a rhythm, a love melody,
Echoing loudly, breaking through bigotry.

In the canvas of life, he paints with delight,
A portrait of love, a beacon so bright.
For love knows no boundaries, no judgment, no line,
And Shawn, with his love, continues to shine.

In the tapestry of diversity, his story is told,
A tale of acceptance, a truth to unfold.
For love knows no gender, no color, no creed,
And in Shawn's embrace, we find what we need.

So here's to Shawn, a beacon so strong,
A testament to love, where he truly belongs.
In this poem we weave, with words pure and true,
Celebrating Shawn and the love that he knew.
